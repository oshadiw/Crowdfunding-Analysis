Analysis on Kickstarter data to determine significant patterns
### Challenge
The purpose of this analysis was to determine how many plays funded through Kickstarter were successful and if the length of the fundraising campaign was a factor in the success rate.

To demonstrate the success rate of Kickstarter plays, the number of successful, failed and canceled plays was calculated and grouped based on the target goal of fundraising. According to the data, there were no canceled plays and the success/failure rate does not show a strong trend pattern with the fundraising goal. This may be due to a number of reasons, the main one being that the outcome of the campaign does not depend solely on the fundraising goal.
